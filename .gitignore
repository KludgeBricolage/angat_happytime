# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
dugo/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
dugo/db/*.sqlite3
dugo/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
dugo/log/*
dugo/tmp/*
dugo/log/.keep
dugo/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
dugo/storage/*
dugo/storage/.keep

dugo/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
dugo/config/master.key
